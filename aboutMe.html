          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            A little bit about myself; I have been an ICU nurse for the past 5
            years or so. During that time I quickly sharpened many skills that
            have proven to be valuable in programming. My critical thinking
            skills allow me to pick apart and break hard problems down into more
            managable ones. While my leadership and communication skills allow
            me to work seemlessly as part of a team.
          </p>
          <h3>Charge Nurse</h3>
          <p>
            As a chanrge nurse I was in charge of keeping an updated patient
            list, as well as admiting and discharging patients on and off the
            unit. This role required detail contric communitcation between me,
            the other nurses on the unit, house supervisors, as well as doctors
            and residents. Given the nature of an ICU setting, the status of
            patients can change moment to moment, so close collaboration and
            immediate action was critical.
          </p>
          <h3>Lead Preceptor</h3>
          <p>
            Another role I had during my nursing career was lead preceptor for
            the ICU. I would precept all new hires for at least part of their
            orientation, if not all of it. I found training new grads the most
            rewarding. They were a blank slate so any thing I taught them had
            the potential to effect their practice indefinetly. I believe this
            role helped me realize what makes a good learner, as well as what it
            takes to be a good teacher/ mentor.
          </p>
          <h3>What Now?</h3>
          <p>
            I had come to a point in my nursing career where I decided I needed
            to start making some career moves. I searched around a bit and none
            of the options were very apealling. In my mind I had two realistic
            options, go into hospital administation or go back to school for a
            masters degree. Neither of those options seemed very appealing at
            the time, this is when I started to explore the world of programing.
          </p>
          <h3>Programing</h3>
          <p>
            I always had a curriosity for programing and developing, but the
            opportunity never fully presented itself. In highschool I took an
            intro to programing class, however I wasn't hooked. The class wasn't
            focused on problem solving and it didn't make programing an
            attractive career. Fastforward to now, and it is proving to be an
            amazing opportunity. In April this year I made the decision to hit
            the breaks on my nursing career and comit to coding full time. I am
            focusing on HTML, CSS, and Javascript to start, but I plan to begin
            developing with Python and other languages very soon.
