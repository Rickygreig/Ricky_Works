            My name is Ricky and as you can tell, this is the first website that
            I have made. I started my early career as an ICU Nurse. After about
            5 years in the ICU (over year on the front lines of COVID), I
            decided I am ready to move on. My options for nursing were either go
            back to school for 2-4 more years, or go into hospital
            administation. Neither option sounded very apealing to me. This is
            when my friend
            <a href="https://github.com/brooksryba">Brooks Ryba</a> introduced
            me to the world of programming!

            I am using this website as a portfolio for my programming career. I
            plan to upload all of my projects and collaborations on my projects
            page. I also plan to add a blog section in the near future to be
            able to talk more in depth about my journey.
