          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            A little bit about myself; I have been an ICU nurse for the past 5
            years or so. During that time I quickly sharpened many skills that
            have proven valuable in programing. I developed strong leadership,
            managerial, and critical thinking skills throughout my career.
          </p>
          <h3>Charge Nurse</h3>
          <p>
            As a chanrge nurse I was in charge of keeping an updated patient
            list, as well as admiting and discharging patients on and off the
            unit. This role required detail contric communitcation between me,
            the other nurses on the unit, house supervisors, as well as doctors.
            Given the nature of an ICU setting, the status of patients change
            moment to moment, so swift collaboration and action is critical.
          </p>
          <h3>Lead Preceptor</h3>
          <p>
            Another role I had during my nursing career was lead preceptor for
            the ICU. All new hires would be with me for at least part of their
            orientation, if not all of it. I found training new grads the most
            rewarding. They were a blank slate so any thing I taught them had
            the potential to effect their practice indefinetly. I believe this
            role helped me realize what makes a good learner, as well as what it
            takes to be a good teacher/ mentor.
          </p>
          <h3>What Now?</h3>
          <p>
            I had come to a point in my nursing career where I decided I needed
            to start making some career moves. I searched around a bit and none
            of the options were very apealling. In my mind I had two realistic
            options, go into hospital administation or go back to school for a
            masters degree. Neither of those options seemed very appealing at
            the time, especially when considering my ICU had been through 4
            managers in my 5 years there.
          </p>
          <h3>Programing</h3>
          <p>
            I had always had a curriosity for programing and developing, but the
            opportunity never fully presented itself. In highschool I took an
            intro to programing class, however I wasn't hooked. The class wasn't
            that great and it didn't make programing an attractive career.
            Fastforward 10 years to now, and it is proving to be an amazing
            opportunity. In April this year I made the decision to hit the
            breaks on my nursing career and comit to coding full time. I am
            focusing on HTML, CSS, and Javascript to start, but I plan to begin
            developing with Python and other languages very soon
